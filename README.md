# MUM
Matt's Universal Macropad (MUM) is my first "big project".
# Features
It features 7 programable macro buttons for almost anything you want. You just have to modify the code on the microcontroller, then you're done!
# The code
The code is written in python and it is where you can configure the macros.
The Code/example.py code has the following macros:
- First row of keys (the two far away from eachother) are volume controls: the left one is vol. up, and the other vol. down.
- The second row is playback control. Left is Backwords, middle is Play/Pause, right is Forwards.
- The third, and last row is copy paste. Left is Copy, and Right is Paste.
